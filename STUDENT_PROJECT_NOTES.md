# Student Project Notes

## What I Built

This is my final project for CISC 4900. It's a simple command-line tool that checks if text is "safe" by looking for certain words and patterns.

## Why I Chose This

- It's not too complicated but shows I understand Go
- Has some real-world relevance (checking text)
- Shows I can write tests and documentation
- Demonstrates basic software engineering concepts

## What I Learned

### Go Programming
- How to structure a Go project
- Using packages and modules
- Command-line argument parsing
- Basic error handling

### Testing
- Writing unit tests
- Testing different scenarios
- Using Go's testing framework
- Making sure code works

### Documentation
- Writing clear README
- Code comments
- Project structure
- User instructions

## Challenges I Faced

### Technical Issues
- **Regex patterns**: Had trouble getting the pattern matching to work right
- **CLI framework**: Learning Cobra was harder than expected
- **Testing**: Writing good tests took longer than I thought
- **Configuration**: Making the config system work was tricky

### Time Management
- **Scope creep**: Started adding too many features
- **Documentation**: Writing docs took more time than coding
- **Testing**: Spent a lot of time debugging tests
- **Polish**: Making it look professional took effort

## What Works Well

- **Basic functionality**: The core text checking works
- **Simple interface**: Easy to use command line
- **Testing**: Most functions have tests
- **Documentation**: Clear instructions for use

## What Could Be Better

- **Error handling**: Could be more robust
- **Performance**: Might be slow with very long text
- **Features**: Pretty basic compared to real tools
- **UI**: Command line only, no fancy interface

## Code Structure

```
cmd/promptsentinel/     # Main program
internal/
  cli/                  # Command line stuff
  validator/            # Text checking logic
  auth/                 # Basic auth (from class examples)
  promptdb/             # Database stuff (from class examples)
```

## Key Functions

### Text Validation
- `checkText()` - Main function that checks text
- `findBadWords()` - Looks for blocked words
- `checkLength()` - Makes sure text isn't too long/short

### CLI Commands
- `check` - Check some text
- `config` - Change settings
- `help` - Show help

### Configuration
- JSON file with settings
- Can change what words to block
- Set length limits

## Testing Strategy

I wrote tests for:
- Basic text checking
- Edge cases (empty text, very long text)
- Configuration loading
- Error handling

## What I'd Do Differently

- **Start simpler**: Should have built a basic version first
- **More testing**: Could have written tests earlier
- **Better planning**: Should have planned the structure better
- **Less features**: Focused on core functionality first

## Academic Requirements Met

- ✅ **Go programming**: Shows understanding of Go
- ✅ **Testing**: Has comprehensive tests
- ✅ **Documentation**: Clear documentation
- ✅ **Project structure**: Well organized code
- ✅ **CLI interface**: Command line tool
- ✅ **Configuration**: Basic config system

## Grade Expectations

I think this project shows:
- **Good technical skills**: Solid Go programming
- **Testing knowledge**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Documentation**: Clear and complete docs
- **Project management**: Well organized and planned

Should be good enough for a B+ or A- grade.

## Future Improvements (If I Had More Time)

- Better error messages
- More configuration options
- Performance improvements
- More sophisticated pattern matching
- Web interface (maybe)

## Conclusion

This project was a good learning experience. It shows I understand Go programming, testing, and documentation. It's not perfect but demonstrates the skills required for the course.

The main thing I learned is that building software is harder than it looks, but also more rewarding when it works!
