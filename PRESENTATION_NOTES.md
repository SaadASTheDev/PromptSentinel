# Presentation Notes - Academic Focus

## Key Points to Emphasize

### 1. **This is a Learning Project**
- "This project was created to demonstrate software engineering principles"
- "It's a simplified educational tool, not production software"
- "The focus is on learning, not commercial viability"

### 2. **Academic Objectives**
- "Demonstrates understanding of Go programming"
- "Shows software engineering best practices"
- "Illustrates testing and documentation skills"
- "Fulfills course requirements for CISC 4900"

### 3. **Educational Value**
- "Shows how to structure a Go project"
- "Demonstrates CLI development with Cobra"
- "Illustrates testing strategies and coverage"
- "Shows professional documentation practices"

### 1. **Introduction (2 minutes)**
- "This is my CISC 4900 capstone project"
- "It demonstrates software engineering principles"
- "The goal was to learn, not to build a business"

### 2. **Technical Overview (3 minutes)**
- Show the code structure and architecture
- Explain the learning objectives
- Demonstrate the CLI functionality
- Show testing and documentation

### 3. **Learning Outcomes (2 minutes)**
- "What I learned about Go programming"
- "Software engineering principles applied"
- "Testing and documentation skills"
- "Project management and planning"

### 4. **Q&A (3 minutes)**
- Focus on technical questions
- Emphasize educational aspects
- Avoid business or commercial discussions

## Sample Talking Points

### **Opening Statement**
"This project demonstrates my understanding of software engineering principles through a simple prompt validation tool. It's designed for learning, not commercial use."

### **Technical Discussion**
"The architecture shows modular design principles, with clear separation between CLI, validation, and configuration layers. This demonstrates good software engineering practices."

### **Learning Focus**
"Through this project, I learned about Go programming, testing strategies, documentation practices, and project management. The focus was on educational value, not commercial potential."

### **Conclusion**
"This project successfully demonstrates the software engineering principles taught in CISC 4900. It's a learning tool that shows technical competency in a controlled, academic environment."

## Handling Questions

### **If Asked About Commercial Use**
"This is an academic project designed for learning. It's not intended for commercial use and shouldn't be used in production environments."

### **If Asked About Business Potential**
"The focus was on demonstrating software engineering principles, not exploring business opportunities. This is a learning exercise."

### **If Asked About Scalability**
"The project was designed to show concepts, not to handle production workloads. It's a simplified educational tool."

## Visual Aids

### **Code Structure Diagram**
- Show modular architecture
- Emphasize educational design
- Highlight learning objectives

### **Testing Coverage**
- Show test results
- Explain testing strategies
- Demonstrate quality practices

### **Documentation**
